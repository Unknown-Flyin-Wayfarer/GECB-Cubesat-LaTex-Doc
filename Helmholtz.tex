\chapter{Designing the actual Helmholtz Coil}


description



\subsection{Aim}

\subsection{Components used:}

\vspace{10pt}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Plywood frame with diameter 50cm
  \item 14SWG Copper wire
  
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Procedure}
We wound the wire around the plywood frame ,150 turns per coil, which was calculated from the formula.The Helmholtz coil is designed to produce 8mT magnetic field and   current .
